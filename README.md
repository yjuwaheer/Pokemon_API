# Pokemon_API
A mini project to generate random pokemon using the RESTful Pok√©mon API.

The mini project is hosted on heroku at https://pokemonapiproject.herokuapp.com/

It might be initially slow to load since the free tier of heroku automatically puts the app to sleep after being inactive for some time.
